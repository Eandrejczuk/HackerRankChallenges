# The manager of a industrial plant is planning to buy a machine of either type A or type B. For each dayâ€™s operation:
#
# The number of repairs, X, that machine A needs is a Poisson random variable with mean 0.88.
# The daily cost of operating A is C_A = 160 + 40X^2.
# The number of repairs, Y, that machine B needs is a Poisson random variable with mean 1.55.
# The daily cost of operating B is C_B = 128 + 40Y^2.

# Assume that the repairs take a negligible amount of time and the machines are maintained nightly
# to ensure that they operate like new at the start of each day.
# Find and print the expected daily cost for each machine.
